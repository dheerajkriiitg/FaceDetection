This contains two input folders "one_face" containg single face images and 'multi_face" containing multiple face images.

The given code takes input from the 'multiple_face_input' folder and returns output in 'multiple_face' folder.You can however change the 
input folder to 'single_face_input' folder and check the output for single face image inputs.The comments are added for this purpose.

After each step of the implementation to display the figure you can uncomment the code to display figure written after that step.But it 
is good that you uncomment it for single image by running the loop one time.

The result for single_face input is stored in 'single_face' folder.
